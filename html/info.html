    <h1>About me</h1>

    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>
      I am a 27 year old man from Norway. I started my journey as a PT/coach
      when i was around 23. i Started early cause i fell in love with training,
      and got a fast grip of it, which lead this way for me. Currently Im
      studying to be a physiotherapist in New Castle. In my spare time i like to
      play video games, watching series, and sometimes occasionally going out
      for a drink with friends. My life is no different from others i believe,
      so like others i have a pretty normal life.
    </p>

    <h2>My interests</h2>
    <p>
      As i mentioned above here, I do like to play videogames in my spare time
      to relaxe from working out etc. I have always played something called
      League of Legends, and recently started Elden ring and Hogwarts Legacy.
      These are both very fun games to play, and i recommend them strongly. If
      I'm not playing games on my PC, im Usually out walking or hanging out with
      friends. I am very interest in our body and it's anatomy, and that made me
      start out as a nurse to begin with, but i wanted to know more, so this is
      why i started my degree as an physiotherapist. This degree will also help
      me to know my clients more, and to understand more if they hurt them
      selfs. These are my interest, which can for many seem like a odd combo,
      which i can understand because i have not met someone with the same combo
      of interests yet.
    </p>
    <h2>My past</h2>
    <p>
      As many people, I had a good childhood with good people around me, who
      supported me for who i was. Everything went well, except when i became a
      teenager where i started to slowly gain a food disorder. I got really
      skinny, and drastically lost weight. i was in and out at the hospital,
      because they had to force feed me. This is a dark part in my life, and
      something i just want to forget. I did not have any energy at all, so all
      i did was laying at home starving my self. I hated the way i looked, but i had no 
      controll over my own body. When i was around 17 i started to get better because of
      better treatment, which saved my life. When i got into my twenties i was fully
      recoverd. This disorder has a lot to do with my career choices. I became a nurse
      to help other people like i was in the past, and later on became a PT and now a
      physiotherapist.
    </p>
<p>I hope this can inspired others to help each other or just look out for each other,
  because food disorder can really dig you into a dark scary hole.
