## Description
This Blog is about working out, and inspire people to start their own journey or continue to make progress. On this blog i posts images of my clients (if allowed), my workouts,  what supplements i use and my cheat days were i eat something more unhealthy to keep my strict eating habits the rest of the week. What makes this blog unique is that i have experience as a nurse, nutrionist, personal trainer and now i'm a physiotherapist. I also have a past with eating disorder, so my knownledge in this field is quite high.

I have posts of what i mentioned earlier, which is in the carousel. I also have posts of what you should avoid eating, best exercises and food for a healthy weight gain/muscle gain. This is just a simple blog where i posts things i care about when training and what i mean you should do and avoid, but also teach you how to workout correctly. I will help you find the best suited workout routines, set up a meal plan and stay in touch with you everyday from 15-22. If you have any questions you can email me, send me a message or fill out the contact form.
